% Unified plots

This document demonstrates the features of unifying plots in `pander`. First, if you do not want to deal with styling each of your images, just activate it: `evalsOptions('graph.unify', TRUE)`.

*Note*: please install `lattice` and `ggplot2` on your computer prior to trying to run all examples of this document.

# Options

There are a bunch of options you might want to check out, these are:

  * graph.nomargin
  * graph.fontfamily
  * graph.fontcolor
  * graph.fontsize
  * graph.grid
  * graph.grid.minor
  * graph.grid.color
  * graph.grid.lty
  * graph.boxes
  * graph.legend.position
  * graph.background
  * graph.panel.background
  * graph.colors
  * graph.color.rnd
  * graph.axis.angle
  * graph.symbol

<!-- end of list -->

# Default options

Not touching the above ones, let us check out how different plots look like by calling `base` R graphing function, `lattice` or `ggplot2`!

## Histogram

### Base R plot

I have no idea how to do that besides manually adding `points`.

I have no idea how to do that besides `par(mfrow=c(foo, bar))`.

# Custom options

Below you can find some images generated by the exact same commands but with some modified `panderOptions`:

```r
panderOptions('graph.fontfamily', "Comic Sans MS")
panderOptions('graph.fontsize', 18)
panderOptions('graph.fontcolor', 'blue')
panderOptions('graph.grid.color', 'blue')
panderOptions('graph.axis.angle', 3)
panderOptions('graph.boxes', T)
panderOptions('graph.legend.position', 'top')
panderOptions('graph.colors', rainbow(5))
panderOptions('graph.grid', FALSE)
panderOptions('graph.symbol', 22)
```

## Histogram

### ggplot2

## Barplot

### Base R plot

![](./plots/graphs-23.png)

Yeah, the "Foo bar" label is cropped. We need a custom `mar` option here:

But wait, we lost the color! Right: unfortunately coloring base R plots is really hackish, `pander` is adding the `col` attribute to the calls. If you start to tweak `par` in a chunk, you should prepare to some unwanted side-effects. Solution:
